Welcome to the Credit Card Complaints dashboard, 
This is an interactive dashboard where you can explore and analyze consumer complaints about credit cards in the United States. This dashboard allows you to see trends and patterns in credit card complaints, with data compiled from a dummy dataset. You can filter the data by various criteria such as card issuer, state, and type of complaint to see how different factors may impact the number and type of complaints received. You can also use the dashboard to understand the most common issues that consumers experience with credit cards and to identify areas where improvement may be needed. We hope this dashboard will be a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about Advance Tableau Dashboards.
